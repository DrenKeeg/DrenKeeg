- 👋 Hi, I’m @DrenKeeg
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to learn. I feel like my teachers in the past were not suited to share their ideas with me, so now i want to become my own teacher.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Html, CSS, Javasript. I would like to be able to do more problem solving and contribute to open source projects for free.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mostly free open source educational material.
- 📫 How to reach me: csirkev@gmail.com
